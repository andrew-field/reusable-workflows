# New deployments are automatically private services, while deploying a revision of a public (unauthenticated) service will preserve the IAM setting of public (unauthenticated).
# The function has been set to allow unauthenticated so it will continue to be unauthenticated. i.e. don't delete the function or set the function to allow unauthenticated after a new fresh deploy.
